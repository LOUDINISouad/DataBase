## 🏹 Missions

### Mission 1: "SQL Basics & Data Querying" 🎓
**Quest**: Familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of SQL, including selecting data, filtering results, and understanding basic joins.  
**Challenge**: Query the customers table to find all customers from a specific city and order the results by their last name.

### Mission 2: "Data Manipulation & Management" 📜
**Quest**: Dive into data insertion, update, and deletion. Learn how to manage database records effectively.  
**Challenge**: Add a new customer to the customers table, update their address, and then delete a customer who is no longer active.

### Mission 3: "Simple Joins & Relationships" 🌌
**Quest**: Explore the concept of table relationships and how to use joins to fetch related data from multiple tables.  
**Challenge 1**: "Understanding Joins" 📊  
**Task**: Practice using INNER JOIN to retrieve data that exists in both orders and customers tables.  
**Challenge 2**: "Expanding with LEFT JOIN" 🔑  
**Task**: Use LEFT JOIN to include customers who have not placed any orders in your query results.

### Mission 4: "Grouping Data & Aggregations" 🔄
**Quest**: Master the use of GROUP BY and aggregate functions like COUNT, AVG, MAX, and MIN to summarize data.  
**Challenge 1**: "Summarizing Sales Data" 🌌  
**Task**: Calculate the total sales per country from the orders table.  
**Challenge 2**: "Customer Insights" 🛠  
**Task**: Find the customer who has placed the most orders.

### Mission 5: "Subqueries & Nested Queries" 📦
**Quest**: Learn how to create complex queries by nesting subqueries within a main query.  
**Challenge 1**: "Identifying Top Performers" 🌐  
**Task**: Use a subquery to identify products that have sold above the average sales.  
**Challenge 2**: "Enhancing Reports with Subqueries" 🌈  
**Task**: Generate a report that shows each customer's last order date using a subquery.

### Mission 6: "Database Functions & Expressions" ⚡
**Quest**: Explore the power of SQL functions and expressions to manipulate and transform data directly in your queries.  
**Challenge 1**: "Data Transformation" 🌍  
**Task**: Use SQL functions to format customer names and calculate order totals with applied discounts.  
**Challenge 2**: "Date & Time Manipulations" 🚀  
**Task**: Extract insights from order dates, such as finding out how many orders were placed in each month of the year.

### Mission 7: "Data Integrity & Constraints" 🌊
**Quest**: Understand the importance of data integrity and how to enforce it using constraints like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE.  
**Challenge 1**: "Implementing Constraints" 🎓  
**Task**: Modify the products table to ensure all products have a unique name and a non-null price.  
**Challenge 2**: "Working with Foreign Keys" 🚀  
**Task**: Add a foreign key constraint to the orders table to enforce a valid relationship with the customers table.
