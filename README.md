Legends speak of an SQL guru, a data architect who will rise, mastering advanced optimization techniques and the art of sharding to ensure the Grand Database Cluster operates at its peak. Your mission, SQL guru, is laden with intricate optimizations and distributed database challenges. With dedication, expertise, and a touch of innovation, enlightenment awaits! ☕️

Are you prepared to embark on this grand odyssey and inscribe your legacy in the annals of Quest?

## Missions

### Mission 1: "The Art of Indexing"
- **Challenge:** Optimize a slow-running query on the books table by implementing the right type of index.

### Mission 2: "Query Execution Plans & Optimization"
- **Challenge:** Analyze the execution plan of a complex query and suggest optimizations based on its insights.

### Mission 3: "Database Sharding & Data Distribution"
- **Challenge 1:** Research and understand the difference between horizontal and vertical sharding.
- **Challenge 2:** Analyze the books table and its access patterns. Determine the most appropriate shard key for horizontal sharding.
- **Challenge 3:** Using a database system of your choice, implement a basic sharding strategy for the books table.
- **Challenge 4:** With your sharded setup, write SQL queries to fetch data across shards.
- **Challenge 5:** Simulate a scenario where a new shard (database) is added to the system.

### Mission 4: "Database Replication & High Availability"
- **Challenge 1:** Research and understand the differences between master-slave and master-master replication strategies.
- **Challenge 2:** Using a database system of your choice, set up a basic master-slave replication for the books table.
- **Challenge 3:** Implement a monitoring solution to track replication lag between the master and slave databases.
- **Challenge 4:** Set up a read replica of the books table and demonstrate how to offload read queries to the replica.

### Mission 5: "Database Partitioning & Efficient Storage"
- **Challenge 1:** Research and understand the differences between horizontal and vertical partitioning.
- **Challenge 2:** Partition the books table horizontally based on year_published.
- **Challenge 3:** Demonstrate how to maintain partitions, including adding new partitions and pruning old ones.

### Mission 6: "Database Caching & Swift Retrievals"
- **Challenge 1:** Research and understand the differences between local and distributed caching mechanisms.
- **Challenge 2:** Implement a caching solution for the books table using a tool like Redis or Memcached.
- **Challenge 3:** Demonstrate how to handle cache eviction and invalidation to ensure data consistency.

### Mission 7: "Cross-Database Queries & Data Fusion"
- **Challenge 1:** Research scenarios where cross-database queries are essential.
- **Challenge 2:** Assuming two databases, Library_A and Library_B, both containing a books table, write SQL queries to fetch data across these databases.
- **Challenge 3:** Given a complex cross-database query, optimize it to improve performance.

### Mission 8: "Load Balancing & Handling Traffic Surges"
- **Challenge 1:** Research and understand the core principles of load balancing as applied to databases.
- **Challenge 2:** Set up a basic load balancing solution for the books database using a tool or platform of your choice.
- **Challenge 3:** Simulate a traffic spike to the books database and demonstrate how your load balancing solution handles it.
